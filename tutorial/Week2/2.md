# Programming with R

## Dates and Times in R

* Dates are stored internally as the number of days since 1970-01-01
* Times are stored internally as the number of seconds since 1970-01-01

### Dates

Dates are represented by the Date class and can be coerced from a string using the `as.Date()` function.

```r
> x <- as.Date("1970-01-01")
> x
[1] "1970-01-01"
```

There are a number of generic functions that work on dates and times:

* `weekdays`: give the day of the week
* `months`: give the month name
* `quarters`: give the quarter number ("Q1", "Q2", "Q3", "Q4")

```r
> weekdays(x)
[1] "Thứ Năm"
> months(x)
[1] "Tháng Giêng"
> quarters(x)
[1] "Q1
```

```r
> x <- Sys.time()
> x
[1] "2023-07-30 21:03:58 +07"
> p <- as.POSIXlt(x)
> p
[1] "2023-07-30 21:03:58 +07"
> names(unclass(p))
 [1] "sec"    "min"    "hour"   "mday"   "mon"   
 [6] "year"   "wday"   "yday"   "isdst"  "zone"  
[11] "gmtoff"
> p$sec
[1] 58.8083
```

The `strptime` function in case your dates are written in a different format:

```r
datestring <- c("August 1, 2023 00:00", "July 31, 2023 9:9")
x <- strptime(datestring, "%B %d, %Y %H:%M")
```

Times use the `POSIXct` and `POSIXlt` class. You can coerced the strings to Date/Time classes using the `strptime` function or the `as.Date`, `as.POSIXlt`, or `as.POSIXct`.
