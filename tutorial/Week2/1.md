# Programming with R

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week you should be able to:

* Write an if-else expression

* Write a for loop, a while loop, and a repeat loop

* Define a function in R and specify its return value [see Functions Part 1 and Part 2]

* Describe how R binds a value to a symbol via the search list

* Define what lexical scoping is with respect to how the value of free variables are resolved in R

* Describe the difference between lexical scoping and dynamic scoping rules

* Convert a character string representing a date/time into an R datetime object.

## Control Structures

Control structures in R allow you to control the flow of execution of the program, depending on runtime conditions. Common structures are:

* `if`, `else`: testing a condition

* `for`: executing a loop a fixed number of times

* `while`: execute a loop while a condition is true

* `repeat`: execute an infinite loop

* `break`: break the execution of a loop

* `next`: skip an interation of a loop

* `return`: exit a function

Most control structures are not used in interactive sessions, but rather when writing functions or longer expressions.

### `if`-`else`

```r
if (<condition>) {
  # do something
} else {
  # do something else
}

if (<condition1>){
  # do something
} else if (<condition2>) {
  # do something different
} else {
  # do something different
}
```

```r
if (x > 3){
  y <- 10
} else {
  y <- 0
}
```

```r
y <- if(x > 3){
  10
} else {
  0
}
```

### `for` loops

`for` loops take an iterator variable and assign it values from a sequence or vector. For loops are most commonly used for iterating over the elements of an object (list, vector, etc/).

```r
> for (i in 1:10) {
+     print(i)
+ }
[1] 1
[1] 2
[1] 3
[1] 4
[1] 5
[1] 6
[1] 7
[1] 8
[1] 9
[1] 10
```

```r
> x <- c("a", "b", "c", "d")
> for(i in 1:4)
+ print(x[i])
[1] "a"
[1] "b"
[1] "c"
[1] "d"
> x <- c("a", "b", "c", "d")
> for(i in 1:4)
+ print(x[i])
[1] "a"
[1] "b"
[1] "c"
[1] "d"
> for(i in seq_along(x))
+ print(x[i])
[1] "a"
[1] "b"
[1] "c"
[1] "d"
> for(c in x)
+ print(c)
[1] "a"
[1] "b"
[1] "c"
[1] "d"
```

The `for` loops can be nested:

```r
> x <- matrix(1:6, 2, 3)
> 
> for(i in seq_len(nrow(x))){
+     for(j in seq_len(ncol(x))){
+         print(x[i, j])
+     }
+ }
[1] 1
[1] 3
[1] 5
[1] 2
[1] 4
[1] 6
```

### `while` loops

`while` loops begin by testing a condition. If it is true, they execute the loop body. Once the loop body is executed, the condition is tested again, and so forth.

```r
> count <- 0
> while(count < 10){
+     print(count)
+     count <- count + 1
+ }
[1] 0
[1] 1
[1] 2
[1] 3
[1] 4
[1] 5
[1] 6
[1] 7
[1] 8
[1] 9
```

### `repeat`, `next`, `break`

`repeat` initiates an infinite loop. The only way to exit a `repeat` loop is to call `break`.

```r
x0 <- 1
to1 <- 1e-8
repeat {
  x1 <- computeEstimate() # an example function
  if(abs(x1 - x0) < to1) {
    break
  } else {
    x0 <- x1
  }
```

`next` is used to skip an iteration of a loop:

```r
for(i in 1:100){
  if(i <= 20){
    # skip the first 20 iterations
    next
  }
  # do something here
}
```

`return` signals that a function should exit and return a given value.

## Functions

Open RStudio, create a new R script and put below code into.

```r
add2number <- function(x, y){
  x + y # return the sum of x and y
}
```
