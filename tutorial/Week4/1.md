# Week 4: Simulation & Profiling

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week you should be able to:

* Call the str function on an arbitrary R object

* Describe the difference between the "by.self" and "by.total" output produced by the R profiler

* Simulate a random normal variable with an arbitrary mean and standard deviation

* Simulate data from a normal linear model

## `str()` function

`str()` displays the internal structure of an R object.

## Generating Random Numbers

Functions for probability distributions in R:

* `rnorm`: generate random Normal variates with a given mean and standard deviation
* `dnorm`: evaluate the Normal probability density (with a given mean/SD) at a point (or vector of points)
* `pnorm`: evaluate the cumulative distribution function for a Normal distribution
* `rpois`: generate random Poisson variates with a given rate

## Simulating a Linear Model

## Random Sampling

## R Profiler
