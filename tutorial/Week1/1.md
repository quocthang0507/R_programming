# Week 1: Welcome to R Programming

## Introduction to R

R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics developed at Bell Laboratories (formerly AT&T, now Lucent Technologies) by John Chambers and colleagues.

R provides a wide variety of statistical and graphical techniques and is highly extensible. R can produce well-designed publication-quality plots, including mathematical symbols and formulae, where needed.

R is available on UNIX platforms and similar systems (including FreeBSD and Linux), Windows, and MacOS.

## The R environment

R is an integrated suite of software facilities for data manipulation, calculation, and graphical display. It includes:

* An effective data handling and storage facility,
* A suite of operators for calculations on arrays, in particular matrices,
* A large, coherent, integrated collection of intermediate tools for data analysis,
* Graphical facilities for data analysis and display either on-screen or on hardcopy, and
* A well-developed, simple, and effective programming language includes conditionals, loops, user-defined recursive functions, and input and output facilities.

The word 'environment' means that R can be extended via *packages*. R has its LaTeX-like documentation format, which supplies comprehensive documentation online in several formats and hard copy.
