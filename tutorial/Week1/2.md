# Getting Started and R Nuts and Bolts

## Learning Objectives

By the end of week 1 you should be able to:

* Install the R and RStudio software packages

* Download and install the swirl package for R

* Describe the history of the S and R programming lectures

* Describe the differences between atomic data types

* Execute basic arithmetic operations

* Subset R objects using the "[", "[[", and "$" operators and logical vectors

* Describe the explicit coercion feature of R

* Remove missing (NA) values from a vector

## R Input and Evaluation

The `<-` symbol is the assignment operator. You can specify a string with leading and tailing by double or single quotation marks.

```r
> x <- 1
> print(x) # explicit printing
[1] 1 # A numeric vector where the first element is the number one
> x # implicit printing
[1] 1
> msg <- "hello" # A string vector where the first element is the string 'hello'
> x <- # Incomplete expression
```

The `#` character indicates a comment.

When a complete expression is entered at the prompt, it is evaluated, and the result of the evaluated expression is returned. The result may be auto-printed.

```r
> x <- 1:20 # creates a integer sequences
> x
[1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
```

## R Data Types: Objects and Attributes

R has five basic or 'atomic' classes of objects:

* character
* numeric (real numbers)
* integer
* complex
* logical (TRUE/FALSE, T/F)

The most basic object is a vector:

* A vector can only contain objects of the same class
* BUT: The one exception is a list, which is represented as a vector but can contain objects of different classes (indeed, that's usually why we use them)

You can create an empty vector with the `vector()` function.

### Numbers

* Numbers in R are generally treated as numeric objects (i.e., double-precision real numbers)
* If you explicitly want an integer, specify the L suffix. Ex: Entering `1` gives you a numeric object, and `1L` gives you an integer.
* `Inf` represents infinity; e.g. `1/0` is `Inf`, and `1/Inf` is `0`.
* `NaN` represents an undefined value ("not a number"); e.g. `0/0` is `NaN`.

### Attributes

R objects can have attributes:

* names, dimnames (dimension names)
* dimensions (e.g. matrices, arrays)
* class
* length
* other user-defined attributes/metadata

Attributes of an object can be accessed using the `attributes()` function.

## Vectors and Lists

### Vectors

The `c()` function can be used to create vectors of objects. `c` stands for concatenating.

```r
> x <- c(0.5, 0.6) # numeric
> x <- c(TRUE, FALSE) # logical
> x <- c(T, F) # logical
> x <- c('a', 'b', 'c') # character
> x <- 0:29 # integer
> x <- c(1+0i, 2+4i) # complex
```

Using the `vector()` function:

```r
> x <- vector("numeric", length = 10)
> x
[1] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

#### Mixing Objects

```r
> y <- c(1.7, 'a') # character
> y
[1] "1.7" "a"  
> y <- c(T, 2) # numeric
> y <- c('a', F) # character
```

When different objects are mixed in a vector, *coercion* occurs so that every element in the vector is of the same class.

#### Explicit Coercion

Objects can be explicitly coerced from one class to another using the `as.*` functions, if available.

```r
> x <- 0:6
> class(x)
[1] "integer"
> as.numeric(x)
[1] 0 1 2 3 4 5 6
> as.logical(x)
[1] FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE
> as.character(x)
[1] "0" "1" "2" "3" "4" "5" "6"
```

Nonsensical coercion results in `NAs`.

```r
> x <- c("a", "b", "c")
> as.numeric(x)
[1] NA NA NA
Warning message:
NAs introduced by coercion 
> as.logical(x)
[1] NA NA NA
> as.complex(x)
[1] NA NA NA
Warning message:
NAs introduced by coercion 
```

### Lists

Lists are a special type of vector that can contain elements of different classes. Lists are a very important data type in R.

```r
> x <- list(1, 'a', TRUE, 1+4i)
> x
[[1]]
[1] 1

[[2]]
[1] "a"

[[3]]
[1] TRUE

[[4]]
[1] 1+4i
```

## Matrices

Matrices are vectors with a dimension attribute. The dimension attribute is itself an integer vector of length 2 (nrow, ncol).

```r
> m <- matrix(nrow = 2, ncol = 3) # creates an empty matrix
> m
     [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,]   NA   NA   NA
[2,]   NA   NA   NA
> dim(m) # the dimension with two rows and three columns
[1] 2 3
> attributes(m)
$dim
[1] 2 3
```

Matrices are constructed *column-wise*:

```r
> m <- matrix(1:6, nrow = 2, ncol = 3)
> m
     [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,]    1    3    5
[2,]    2    4    6
```

Another way to create a matrix from a vector:

```r
> m <- 1:10
> m
 [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
> dim(m) <- c(2, 5)
> m
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]
[1,]    1    3    5    7    9
[2,]    2    4    6    8   10
```

### cbind-ing and rbind-ing

Matrices can be created by *column-binding* or *row-binding* with `cbind()` and `rbind()`.

```r
> x <- 1:3
> y <- 10:12
> cbind(x, y)
     x  y
[1,] 1 10
[2,] 2 11
[3,] 3 12
> rbind(x, y)
  [,1] [,2] [,3]
x    1    2    3
y   10   11   12
```

## Data Types - Factors

Factors are used to represent categorical data. Factors can be unordered or ordered.

* Factors are treated specially by modeling functions like `lm()` and `glm()`

* Using factors with labels is better than using integers because factors are self-describing

```r
> x <- factor(c("yes", "yes", "no", "yes", "no"))
> x
[1] yes yes no  yes no 
Levels: no yes
> table(x)
x
 no yes 
  2   3 
> unclass(x)
[1] 2 2 1 2 1
attr(,"levels")
[1] "no"  "yes"
```

The order of the levels can be set using the `levels` argument to `factor()`:

```r
> x <- factor(c("yes", "yes", "no", "yes", "no"), levels = c("yes", "no"))
> x
[1] yes yes no  yes no 
Levels: yes no
```

## Data Types - Missing Values

Missing values are denoted by `NA` or `NaN` for undefined mathematical operations.

* `is.na()` is used to test objects if they are `NA`
* `is.nan()` is used to test for `NaN`
* `NA` values have a class also, so there are integer `NA`, character `NA`, etc.
* A `NaN` value is also `NA` but the converse is not true.

```r
> x <- c(1, 2, NA, 10, 3)
> is.na(x)
[1] FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE
> is.nan(x)
[1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE
> x <- c(1, 2, NaN, NA, 4)
> is.na(x)
[1] FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE
> is.nan(x)
[1] FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE
```

## Data Types - Data Frames

Data frames are used to store tabular data:

* They are represented as a special type of list where every element of the list has to have the same length
* Each element of the list can be thought of as a column and the length of each element of the the list is the number of rows
* Unlike matrices, data frames can store different classes of objects in each column (just like lists); matrices must have every element be the same class
* Data frames also have a special attribute called `row.names`
* Data frames are usually created by calling `read.table()` or `read.csv()`
* Can be converted to a matrix by calling `data.matrix()`

```r
> x <- data.frame(foo = 1:4, bar = c(T, T, F, F))
> x
  foo   bar
1   1  TRUE
2   2  TRUE
3   3 FALSE
4   4 FALSE
> nrow(x)
[1] 4
> ncol(x)
[1] 2
```

## Data Types - Names Attribute

R objects can also have names, which is very useful for writing readable code and self-describing objects.

```r
> x <- 1:3
> names(x)
NULL
> names(x) <- c("foo", "bar", "norf")
> x
 foo  bar norf 
   1    2    3 
> names(x)
[1] "foo"  "bar"  "norf"
```

Lists can also have names:

```r
> x <- list(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3)
> x
$a
[1] 1

$b
[1] 2

$c
[1] 3
```

And matrices:

```r
> m <- matrix(1:4, nrow = 2, ncol = 2)
> dimnames(m) <- list(c("a", "b"), c("c", "d"))
> m
  c d
a 1 3
b 2 4
```

## Reading and Writing Tabular Data

There are a few principal functions reading data into R:

* `read.table`, `read.csv` for reading tabular data

The `read.table` function is one of the most commonly used functions for reading data. It has a few important arguments: `file`, `header`, `sep`,...

* `readLines` for reading lines of a text file
* `source` for reading in R code files (`inverse` of `dump`)
* `dget` for reading in R code files (`inverse` of `dput`)
* `load` for reading in saved workspaces
* `unserialize` for reading single R objects in binary form

There are analogous functions for writing data to files:

* `write.table`
* `writeLines`
* `dump`
* `dput`
* `save`
* `serialize`

```r
> data <- read.table("foo.txt")
Error in file(file, "rt") : cannot open the connection
In addition: Warning message:
In file(file, "rt") : cannot open file 'foo.txt': No such file or directory
>
> data <- read.table("http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/jcgs/tu", skip = 4, header = T)
> data
    XL XR ZL ZR AGE MULT TRT
1   15 24  1 24   1   13   1
2   15 24  1 24   2    6   1
3   16 24  1 24   1   15   1
4   16 24  1 24   2   16   1
5   17 24  1 24   1    9   1
6   17 24  1 24   2    1   1
7   18 24  1 24   1    1   1
8    1  5 23 24   1    2   1
9    1 15 23 24   1    7   1
10   1 15 23 24   2    2   1
...
```

R will  automatically:

* skip lines that begin with a `#`
* figure out how many rows there are (how much memory needs to be allocated)
* figure what type of variable is in each column of the table
* `read.csv` is identical to `read.table` except that the default seperator is a comma.

With much larger datasets, doing the following things will prevent R from choking:

* Read the help page for `read.table`
* Make a rough calculation of the memory required to store the dataset
* Set `comment.char = ""` if there are no commented lines in the file

Use the `colClasses` argument to specify classes in data frame. Set `nrows` doesn't make R run faster but it helps with momory usage.

## Textual Data Formats

* `dump` and `dput` are useful because the resulting textual format is editable, and in the case of corruption, potentially recoverable.
* Unlike writing out a table or csv file, `dump` and `dput` preserve the *metadata* (sacrificing some readability), so that another user doesn't have to specify it all over again.
* Textual formats can work much better with version control programs like *subversion* or *git*.
* Textual formats can be longer-lived; if there is corruption somewhere in the file, it can be easier to fix the problem.
* Textual formats adhere to the 'Unix philosophy'.
* Downside: The format is not very space-efficient.

### `dput-ting` R Objects

Another way to pass data around is by deparsing the R object with `dput` and reading it back in using `dget`:

```r
> y <- data.frame(a = 1, b = 'a')
> dput(y)
structure(list(a = 1, b = "a"), class = "data.frame", row.names = c(NA, 
-1L))
> dput(y, file = "y.R")
> new.y <- dget("y.R")
> new.y
  a b
1 1 a
```

### `dump-ing` R Objects

Multiple objects can be deparsed using the `dump` function and read back in using `source`:

```r
> x <- "foo"
> y <- data.frame(a = 1, b = "a")
> dump(c("x", "y"), file = "data.R")
> rm(x, y)
> source("data.R")
> y
  a b
1 1 a
> x
[1] "foo"
```

## Connections: Interfaces to the Outside World

Data are read in using `connection` interfaces. Connections can be made to files (most common) or to other more exotic things.

* `file` opens a connection to a file
* `gzfile` opens a connection to a file compressed with `gzip`
* `bzfile` opens a connection to a file compressed with `bzip2`
* `url` opens a connection to a webpage

```r
> str(file)
function (description = "", open = "", blocking = TRUE, encoding = getOption("encoding"), 
    raw = FALSE, method = getOption("url.method", "default"))  
```

* `description` is the name of the file
* `open` is a code indicating:

** `r` read only
** `w` writing (and initializing a new file)
** `a` appending
** `rb`, `wb`, `ab` for reading, writing, or appending in binary mode (Windows)

```r
> con <- file('http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/jcgs/tu', 'r')
> data <- read.table(con, skip = 4, header=T)
> close(con)
> data
    XL XR ZL ZR AGE MULT TRT
1   15 24  1 24   1   13   1
2   15 24  1 24   2    6   1
3   16 24  1 24   1   15   1
4   16 24  1 24   2   16   1
5   17 24  1 24   1    9   1
6   17 24  1 24   2    1   1
7   18 24  1 24   1    1   1
8    1  5 23 24   1    2   1
9    1 15 23 24   1    7   1
10   1 15 23 24   2    2   1
...
```

is the same as:

```r
data <- read.table('http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/jcgs/tu', skip = 4, header=T)
```

```r
> con <- gzfile('words.gz')
> x <- readLines(con, 10)
> x
 [1] "1080"         "10-point"     "10th"         "11-point"
 [5] "12-point"     "16-point"     "18-point"     "1st"
 [9] "2"            "20-point"
```

`writeLines` takes a character vector and writes each element one line at a time to a text file.

```r
> con <- url('http://example.com', 'r')
> x <- readLines(con)
> head(x)
[1] "<!doctype html>"                   "<html>"                           
[3] "<head>"                            "    <title>Example Domain</title>"
[5] ""                                  "    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />"
```

## Vectorized Operations

Many operations in R are *vectorized* making code more efficient, concise, and easier to read.

```r
> x <- 1:4; y <- 6:9
> x + y
[1]  7  9 11 13
> x > 2
[1] FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE
> x >= 2
[1] FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE
> y == 8
[1] FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE
> x * y
[1]  6 14 24 36
> x / y
[1] 0.1666667 0.2857143 0.3750000 0.4444444
```

```r
> x <- matrix(1:4, 2, 2); y <- matrix(rep(10, 4), 2, 2)
> x
     [,1] [,2]
[1,]    1    3
[2,]    2    4
> y
     [,1] [,2]
[1,]   10   10
[2,]   10   10
> x * y     # element-wise multiplication
     [,1] [,2]
[1,]   10   30
[2,]   20   40
> x / y
     [,1] [,2]
[1,]  0.1  0.3
[2,]  0.2  0.4
> x %*% y   # true matrix multiplication
     [,1] [,2]
[1,]   40   40
[2,]   60   60
```
