# Getting Started and R Nuts and Bolts

## Learning Objectives

By the end of week 1 you should be able to:

* Install the R and RStudio software packages

* Download and install the swirl package for R

* Describe the history of the S and R programming lectures

* Describe the differences between atomic data types

* Execute basic arithmetic operations

* Subset R objects using the "[", "[[", and "$" operators and logical vectors

* Describe the explicit coercion feature of R

* Remove missing (NA) values from a vector

## R Input and Evaluation

The `<-` symbol is the assignment operator. You can specify a string with leading and tailing by double or single quotation marks.

```r
> x <- 1
> print(x) # explicit printing
[1] 1 # A numeric vector where the first element is the number one
> x # implicit printing
[1] 1
> msg <- "hello" # A string vector where the first element is the string 'hello'
> x <- # Incomplete expression
```

The `#` character indicates a comment.

When a complete expression is entered at the prompt, it is evaluated, and the result of the evaluated expression is returned. The result may be auto-printed.

```r
> x <- 1:20 # creates a integer sequences
> x
[1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
```

## R Data Types: Objects and Attributes

R has five basic or 'atomic' classes of objects:

* character
* numeric (real numbers)
* integer
* complex
* logical (TRUE/FALSE, T/F)

The most basic object is a vector:

* A vector can only contain objects of the same class
* BUT: The one exception is a list, which is represented as a vector but can contain objects of different classes (indeed, that's usually why we use them)

You can create an empty vector with the `vector()` function.

### Numbers

* Numbers in R are generally treated as numeric objects (i.e., double-precision real numbers)
* If you explicitly want an integer, specify the L suffix. Ex: Entering `1` gives you a numeric object, and `1L` gives you an integer.
* `Inf` represents infinity; e.g. `1/0` is `Inf`, and `1/Inf` is `0`.
* `NaN` represents an undefined value ("not a number"); e.g. `0/0` is `NaN`.

### Attributes

R objects can have attributes:

* names, dimnames (dimension names)
* dimensions (e.g. matrices, arrays)
* class
* length
* other user-defined attributes/metadata

Attributes of an object can be accessed using the `attributes()` function.

## Vectors and Lists

### Vectors

The `c()` function can be used to create vectors of objects. `c` stands for concatenating.

```r
> x <- c(0.5, 0.6) # numeric
> x <- c(TRUE, FALSE) # logical
> x <- c(T, F) # logical
> x <- c('a', 'b', 'c') # character
> x <- 0:29 # integer
> x <- c(1+0i, 2+4i) # complex
```

Using the `vector()` function:

```r
> x <- vector("numeric", length = 10)
> x
[1] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

#### Mixing Objects

```r
> y <- c(1.7, 'a') # character
> y
[1] "1.7" "a"  
> y <- c(T, 2) # numeric
> y <- c('a', F) # character
```

When different objects are mixed in a vector, *coercion* occurs so that every element in the vector is of the same class.

#### Explicit Coercion

Objects can be explicitly coerced from one class to another using the `as.*` functions, if available.

```r
> x <- 0:6
> class(x)
[1] "integer"
> as.numeric(x)
[1] 0 1 2 3 4 5 6
> as.logical(x)
[1] FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE
> as.character(x)
[1] "0" "1" "2" "3" "4" "5" "6"
```

Nonsensical coercion results in `NAs`.

```r
> x <- c("a", "b", "c")
> as.numeric(x)
[1] NA NA NA
Warning message:
NAs introduced by coercion 
> as.logical(x)
[1] NA NA NA
> as.complex(x)
[1] NA NA NA
Warning message:
NAs introduced by coercion 
```

### Lists

Lists are a special type of vector that can contain elements of different classes. Lists are a very important data type in R.

```r
> x <- list(1, 'a', TRUE, 1+4i)
> x
[[1]]
[1] 1

[[2]]
[1] "a"

[[3]]
[1] TRUE

[[4]]
[1] 1+4i
```

## Matrices

Matrices are vectors with a dimension attribute. The dimension attribute is itself an integer vector of length 2 (nrow, ncol).

```r
> m <- matrix(nrow = 2, ncol = 3) # creates an empty matrix
> m
     [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,]   NA   NA   NA
[2,]   NA   NA   NA
> dim(m) # the dimension with two rows and three columns
[1] 2 3
> attributes(m)
$dim
[1] 2 3
```

Matrices are constructed *column-wise*:

```r
> m <- matrix(1:6, nrow = 2, ncol = 3)
> m
     [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,]    1    3    5
[2,]    2    4    6
```

Another way to create a matrix from a vector:

```r
> m <- 1:10
> m
 [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
> dim(m) <- c(2, 5)
> m
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]
[1,]    1    3    5    7    9
[2,]    2    4    6    8   10
```

### cbind-ing and rbind-ing

Matrices can be created by *column-binding* or *row-binding* with `cbind()` and `rbind()`.

```r
> x <- 1:3
> y <- 10:12
> cbind(x, y)
     x  y
[1,] 1 10
[2,] 2 11
[3,] 3 12
> rbind(x, y)
  [,1] [,2] [,3]
x    1    2    3
y   10   11   12
```
